Code 1: IP_CD_EXT.py
Python code for Image Pre-processing, Circle detection and Extraction of data to .csv files

Code 2: TSA12.py TSA17.py with same functionalities contain the Machine Learning based Data Analysis and Time Series Prediction codes (Require csv files in same folder as .py file). All ML models have been fitted, predicted in one single code

Code 3: prophet_analysis2.py focuses on prophet analysis and forecasting only. Will work with big amounts of data.

Code 4: KDE.py Using Kernel Density Estimation (Non-ML approach) predicts size distribution. Could be used for taking insights and applying it with ML together in TSA17/TSA12.py
